Object-Oriented Design Principles
-
- Single Responsibility Principle(SRP) - Every object should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
- Open-Closed Principle(OCP) - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modificaiton.
- Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP) - Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- Depedence Inversion Principle(DIP) - Program to an interface, not an implementation. (Constructor Injection, Setter Injection and Interface Injection)
- Interface Segregation Principle(ISP) - Once an interface has gotten too 'fat', it needs to be split into smaller and more specific interfaces so that any clients of the interface will only know about the methods that pertain to them.
- Composite Reuse Principle(CRP) - Favor composition of objects over interitance as a reuse mechanism.
- Law of Demeter(LoD) / Least Knowledge Principle (LKP) - Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units 'closedly' related to the current unit.
